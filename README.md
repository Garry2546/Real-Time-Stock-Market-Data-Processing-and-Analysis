# Stock-Market-Analysis

This project showcases a complete data pipeline for real-time stock market data processing and analysis using AWS and Apache Kafka. It captures real-time stock data, processes it, stores it in Amazon S3, catalogs it using AWS Glue, and allows for querying with Amazon Athena. The architecture is designed for scalability, durability, and ease of analysis, leveraging modern cloud technologies and data engineering practices.

This project can be used as a reference architecture for financial data processing, IoT data streaming, or any application requiring real-time data ingestion, processing, and analysis.
