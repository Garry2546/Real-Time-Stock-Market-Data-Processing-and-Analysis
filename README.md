# Stock-Market-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time stock market data processing and analysis system using modern data engineering and cloud technologies. The architecture captures real-time stock data, processes it, and stores it for further analysis using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The system leverages Apache Kafka for data streaming, Amazon S3 for storage, AWS Glue for data cataloging, and Amazon Athena for querying the stored data.
